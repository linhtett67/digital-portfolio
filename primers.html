      <h2>Focus of the Project</h2>
      <p class="image-description">
        The primary focus of this website is UX design. <br>
        A total of 16 design prototypes were made to determine
        the most suitable format to convey information to readers, structuring and formatting the information in a way that users can get a clear grasp
        of NYP Primers just by skimming through the web pages.
        </p>

        <h2>Technologies used</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
        </p>
