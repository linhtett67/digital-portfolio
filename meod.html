                The authentication page is designed to check check user credentials against existing accounts

                        Strictly, no user account is allowed for security purposes. <br>
                        The credentials users input are passed to supabase using parameterized statements queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

                        Passwords are handled by supabase. Not even admins have access to the them to minimize damage if compromised. <br>

                        To provide role-based authentication, the roles of users along with their personal information 
                        are stored in a separate staff table. <br>
                        In other words, authentication occurs twice before granting access to the system. <br>
                        Even if users could bypass the supabase authentication system,
                        they won't get access to the system unless their IDs are not in the staff table.
